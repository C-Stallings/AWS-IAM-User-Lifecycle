# AWS IAM User Lifecycle | IT Support


## Project Overview

This project simulates core tasks that an IT Support or Help Desk professional would perform daily using AWS IAM. It demonstrates user onboarding, access control, password resets, and MFA enforcement.


## 📌 Project Goals

- Simulate onboarding a new user in AWS
- Assign IAM roles and permissions
- Perform a password reset scenario
- Enforce MFA (multi-factor authentication)
- Offboard a user securely

---

## 🧰 Tools & Services Used

| Service | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| AWS IAM | Identity & Access Management |
| AWS Console | User management |
| AWS CLI (optional) | Automate password resets |
| Google Authenticator | MFA enforcement |

---

## 🔐 Key Tasks Demonstrated

### ✅ 1. IAM Group & Policy Setup
- Created a group called `SupportTeam`
- Attached `AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess` policy

### ✅ 2. User Onboarding
- Added a new IAM user (`test1@team37154.testinator.com`)
- Assigned to `SupportTeam`
- Enabled AWS Console access with password reset required

### ✅ 3. First-Time Login Simulation
- User logged in via IAM Sign-In link
- Forced to set a new password
- Validated limited EC2 access

### ✅ 4. Password Reset
- Admin must require reset password from IAM Console

### ✅ 5. MFA Setup
- Virtual MFA enabled using Authenticator
- Backup codes saved securely

### ✅ 6. Offboarding
- Removed policies and group access
- Delete user from IAM

## Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Create an IAM Group

> ✅ **Why?** Groups let you manage permissions consistently.
1. Go to the **IAM Console** → **User groups** → **Create group**
2. Name the group: `SupportTeam`
3. Click **Attach policies**
4. Select the policy: `AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess`
5. Click **Create group**

</p>

### Step 2: Create a New IAM User (Onboarding)

> ✅ Simulate adding a new team member with scoped permissions.

1. Go to **IAM Console** → **Users** → **Add users**
2. Enter username: `test1@team37154.testinator.com`
3. Access type: ✅ **AWS Management Console access**
4. Check:
   - ✅ **Autogenerated password**
   - ✅ **Require password reset at next sign-in**
5. Click **Next** → **Add user to group**
6. Select: `SupportTeam`
7. Click **Create user**

<p align="center">

    height="50%" 
    width="50%" 
    alt="SS_Create_User_2"
  />
</p>

---

### Step 3: Simulate First Login (as the New User)

> ✅ Simulate what the user experiences during first sign-in.

1. Open an **incognito window** or **different browser**
2. Go to the IAM sign-in URL (shown after user creation)
3. Log in as `test1@team37154.testinator.com` with the temp password
4. You’ll be prompted to **create a new password**
5. After login, explore the **restricted EC2 view** (read-only)

    width="50%" 
    alt="SS_New_User_Login_1"
  />
</p>

### Step 4: Reset User Password (Help Desk Simulation)

> ✅ Simulate a help desk ticket for password reset (manual and via AWS CLI).

1. As admin, return to **IAM Console**
2. Navigate to **Users** → `test1@team37154.testinator.com`
3. Click **Security credentials**
4. Under **Console access**, click **Manage Console access**
5. Choose:
   - ✅ **Custom password** (e.g., `Temp123!`)
   - ✅ **Require password reset at next sign-in**
6. Click **Apply**

7. **Via AWS CLI**:
```bash
  aws iam update-login-profile \
    --user-name test1@team37154.testinator.com \
    --password "Temp123!" \
    --password-reset-required
```

  />
</p>

### Step 5: Enable MFA (Security Best Practice)

> ✅ Enforcing MFA for identity protection.

1. As an Admin → Go to **Users** → `test1@team37154.testinator.com`
2. Go to **My Security Credentials** (top-right dropdown)
3. Click **Assign MFA device**
4. Choose: ✅ **Virtual MFA device**
5. Enter a **device name**, e.g., `test-mfa`
6. Open the **Google Authenticator** app and scan the QR code
7. Enter **two consecutive codes** displayed in the app
8. Click **Assign MFA**

<p align="center">

    width="50%" 
    alt="SS_MFA_1"
  />
</p>

### Step 6: Offboarding Process

> ✅ Offboarding process for what happens when a user leaves the company.

1. As an Admin → Go to **Users** → `test1@team37154.testinator.com`
2. **Detach** from any IAM groups (e.g., `SupportTeam`)
3. **Remove** attached policies (if any)
4. Optionally:
   - Disable AWS Console access
   - Or delete the IAM user entirely

## Lessons Learned

- **IAM simplifies centralized user management** by enabling scalable, role-based access control across AWS resources.
- **User groups and managed policies** streamline permission assignment and reduce configuration errors.
- **Password reset workflows and login profile management** closely mirror real-world help desk procedures.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** enhances account security and reflects best practices in identity protection.
- **Console and CLI options** both offer flexibility for IT support staff to automate or manually resolve access issues.
- Simulating **onboarding and offboarding** ensures compliance with security policies and access hygiene in cloud environments.
